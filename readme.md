This extension only compatible with chrome

This extension is for me to learn how popup,background, and content can send and receive message on one another

how to use : go to chrome://extensions/ on the chrome address bar -> enable developer mode -> load unpacked -> select this extension folder(worddef) -> pin this extension on your tab

this extension let you select/highlight a text from a webpage then when you select the extension icon you will see the word definition from the text you selected/highlighted using your mouse
